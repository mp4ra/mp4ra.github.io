diap,"""Box signaling dialogue gain for AC‑4 preselections in CMAF/ISOBMFF files.

**Technical summary**: The `diap` box (DialogueProcessingBox) extends FullBox and contains a signed 16-bit `dialog_gain` field. It represents the gain applied to the dialogue component compared to the default mix.
**Location**: `prsl/udta/diap` (child of User Data Box inside PreselectionGroupBox).

Used to differentiate preselections that share language, role and other attributes but differ in dialogue level. The `diap` box complements existing preselection metadata structures (`prsl`) and supports accessibility and personalization features in AC‑4 CMAF workflows.""",
