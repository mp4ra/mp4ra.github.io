# Uncompressed Video Profiles

The table below shows some "well-known" 4CCs that are used in the industry to represent pre-defined configurations for uncompressed video.
Some of these profiles have been originally defined in [TN2162](https://developer.apple.com/library/archive/technotes/tn2162/_index.html) (Ice Floe Dispatch 19).

ISO/IEC 23001-17: "*Carriage of uncompressed video and images in ISO Base Media File Format*" summarizes some of the profiles defined in this table.
